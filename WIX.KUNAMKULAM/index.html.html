<h1 style="color: Purple"> How to make them ?</h1>
<h3 style="color: Green ">Follow these instructions</h3>
<p style="color: blue">Ingredients </p>
<ul> <li> 1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li> 1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li> 2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup milk</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: blue">Instructions </p>
<ol> <li> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
 <li> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
 <li> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy using an electric mixer.</li>
 <li> Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
 <li> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cupcakes tough.</li>
 <li> Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
 <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
 <li> Allow the cupcakes to cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.</li></ol>
<p> You can frost these cupcakes with your favorite frosting, such as buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or chocolate ganache!</p>
